Update Bazaar Prices

Start by installing a Java IDE and get that setup.  Then just run this project and hit the button to modify your toon's buyer prices.  The only bit of code you have to change is to update the buyerFilePath variable with your own filepath to your character's BART_charname_server.ini.  Enjoy
